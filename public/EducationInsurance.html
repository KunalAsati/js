						<h2>What is Education Insurance?</h2>
						<h4>Child life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance that insures the life of a minor. It is usually purchased to protect a family against the sudden and unexpected costs of a child’s funeral or burial and to secure inexpensive and guaranteed insurance for the lifetime of the child. It offers guaranteed growth of cash value, which some carriers allow to be withdrawn (collapsing the policy) when the child is in their early twenties.Child life insurance policies typically offer the owner the option to purchase, or in some cases obtain additional guaranteed insurance when the child reaches maturity </h4>

					<h3>Education Insurance And It's Importance</h3>

					<p>A child insurance plan provides the dual benefits of insurance and investment. Parents can buy such a plan when the child is as young as 14 days. The policy matures when the child attains adulthood. However, there are child insurance policies where in policyholders are allowed to make periodic or occasional withdrawals before maturity of the plan.
						Buying child insurance means there is investment planning involved for large number of years, which is why it is a superb tool when planning for the future. Mentioned below are some long-term advantages of child insurance plans.</p>

<h4> 1.Funding Children's Education– Major chunk of the parents' savings goes into paying for their child's education. Studying in a decent school means shelling out a lot of money. Higher education in abroad or MBA from well known B-school would mean exhaustion of the limited savings. All of that could be afforded by buying a child investment plan as the sum obtained on the maturity of the plan would help lessen this financial burden to quite an extent.
</h4>
<h4> 2. Critical illness/ Medical emergency Aid– In case there is a family history of critical illness, it is advisable to purchase children insurance when he/she is young and fit. If due to a medical emergency, the child has to be hospitalized, a child plan would help by offering financial support. You are allowed to withdraw a lump sum from the about-to-mature policy to make sure that your child gets the necessary medical treatment.
</h4>
<h4> 3. Unexpected Demise of a Parent– Death is never anticipated, especially when one is young. In the event of the demise of a parent during the term of a child insurance policy, the insurance company provides a premium waiver. Thus, the beneficiary gets a lump sum amount and is no longer obligated to pay any premium on the policy.
</h4>
<h4> 4. Well thought of investment– Prior to buying child insurance, Be sure of what you are planning for, whether higher education for your child, marriage, or even a mortgage on a house. While performing calculations, take inflation into account. Prices fluctuate largely in less than a decade. Once you have decided on an amount, buy a suitable child insurance policy. You will soon get into the habit of making regular premium payments and as a result you will be successfully earmarking money for your child's future.
<h4>
<h4> 5. Income Security for Your Child– This is an important benefit for children who are actors, singers and others who earn great incomes at a young age. Their money tends to heighten at a higher rate over a longer period when put in investment plans for children.
</h4>
<h4> 6. Could be used to take Secured Loan– A child insurance plan is also largely accepted as security by banks and other lenders when processing education loans or other personal loans.
</h4>
 <p>When buying child insurance, search for policies that emphasize on cash value. High cash value, in long run, can be used to take loans or make a down payment on a house. Steer clear of policies that raise premium rates annually. Most importantly, buy insurance while you child is young to take advantage of low rates and high returns.

					 <h3>What should be my ideal health insurance cover?</h3>
					 <p>The cost of education in India is increasing at a fast pace. From primary to secondary to higher education, parents are increasingly finding it difficult to meet the growing fee structure and other costs associated with education.</p>
					 <p>According to National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), between 2008 and 2014, the average annual private expenditure for general education (primary level to post graduation and above) shot up by a staggering 175 percent while during the same period, the annual cost of professional and technical education increased by 96 percent. The expenses typically include course fees, books, transportation, coaching and other related costs.</p>
					 <p>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/child.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Your kids have dreams. They will start planning a great future and might want to conquer the whole world. And all you have to do is to make sure they keep doing what they want to do. But without quality education, there is no bright future. You must buy a child education plan right away because of:</p>
					<h3>High Cost of Education:</h3>
						<p>You already know how expensive it is to live and educate yourself. Education will be even more expensive in the future. From school picnics, fancy dress competitions, sports equipment to exorbitantly high tuition fees in school and colleges, you have to be ready to pay huge amounts for your child’s growth.</p>
						<h3>Get More For Small And Regular Investments:</h3>
						<p>By investing an amount of money regularly, your investments compound into a handsome sum in the future. This corpus would reduce the financial burden and take off the worry about making timely fee payments for your child’s university degree.</p>
						<h3>Avoid Loans:</h3>
						<p>The most common way to arrange funds for expensive degrees is an educational loan. If you’re a young parent, you might yourself be paying your education loans right now. Why take up additional liability? That is the time when your savings that you started doing today will help you the most.</p>
						<h3>Investment and protection:</h3>
						<p>Through an endowment plan for child education, you get the dual benefits of insurance and investments. By adding a waiver of premium rider, no future premiums need to be paid in your absence. Even if something were to happen to you, your child’s dreams would not be stopped. It will help you in keeping the promise intact. Your children can go to whichever country and opt for whatever course they want.</p>
						<h3>Tax Benefits:</h3>
						<p>You also get tax benefits with a child insurance plan. The premium is deductible under section 80(C) and the maturity amount is exempt from tax; unlike fixed deposits or equity shares which attract a long-term capital gains tax.

Take right steps at right time, be the parent who is prepared for the future. Invest in the right plans that help in securing your child's future, in your presence and even in your absence.</p>


					<h2>WHY BUY THIS POLICY?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The plan enables you to save systematically until your child turns 17 years for his/her graduation or post-graduation college fees</li>
<li>It offers you three options to receive Guaranteed payouts depending on your child's education milestones so that you receive the money when it is actually needed</li>
<li>Your child's education is secured even in case of an unfortunate event in your life</li>
<li>You can further strengthen your plan by opting for riders which covers you against an accidental death and/or accidental total and permanent disability</li>
<li>You are eligible for Tax benefits as per prevailing tax laws</li>
</ul>
<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/1e.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p><strong> Maturity Benefit:</strong><br /> Now, you can be in complete control of your child's higher education by receiving guaranteed payouts. These payouts are designed in such a way that you are sure to use it only for payment of admission or tuition fees. Moreover, you have the flexibility to choose between three options, Option A, B or C, to receive these payouts as per your child's education milestones</p>
<p><strong>Let us understand your benefits with the help of an example</strong></p>
<p>Raj is 30 years old and the father of a 1 year old, Aryan. As per his financial plan, he needs to get <img class="rsImg" src="/images/rsicon2.png" alt="Rs" align="absmiddle" />20 lakhs to fund Aryan's tuition fees through yearly payouts.</p>
<ul class="listStyle8 w100per" style="padding: 0 0 10px 0;">
<li>He can choose to receive the maturity benefits as yearly payouts either as per Option A, B or C.</li>
<li>The Policy Term and Premium Payment Term is 16 years as Aryan is 1 year old at beginning of the policy</li>
<li>When Aryan turns 17 years, Raj will start receiving the guaranteed payouts.</li>
<li>Raj has the option to receive this as under:</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Maturity Benefit to meet College Expenses</b></h3>
<p>Most of the parents wish their child to take up professional courses to be an engineer, architect, lawyer, or doctor. However, the fees for these courses are becoming increasingly unaffordable, such that you may have to avail a loan to meet your child's education needs. If you have wisely started investing in a child plan at an early age, then the investment corpus gathered at the time of maturity will be adequate to meet the inflated fees of colleges.</p>
<h3><b>Facility to avoid Capital Erosion</b></h3>
<p>As markets fluctuate, the returns over investments vary. To make the best of the invested amount and save it from <a>capital erosion</a>, <a>dynamic fund allocation</a> strategy needs to be adopted. Child plans offer privileges of fund selection and Systematic Transfer Plan or STP to plan your investments as per expected returns required during different life stages. Through STP, you can automatically switch the purchased units of funds to make the best of market volatility.</p>
<h3><b>Options to Choose Riders</b></h3>
<p>Certain plans will waive off the entire premium to be paid during the policy tenure if the insured person passes away. Similarly, <a>rider</a>s such as personal accident insurance <a>rider </a>are useful if the person purchasing the plan is not around anymore, or is severely injured.</p>
<h3><b>Partial Withdrawals to Enhance your Child's Talent</b></h3>
<p>If your child possesses a special talent, such as acting or instrument playing, you can nurture it further by making partial withdrawals from the child education plan. Moreover, certain plans come with periodic pay-outs that will be useful to meet the expenses incurred while enhancing your child's talent further.</p>
<h3><b>Support for your child's school fees</b></h3>
<p>If the parent purchasing the child plan is not around anymore, then the insurance company pays around 10% of the sum assured immediately, and periodic annual pay-outs amounting to 10% of the sum assured are paid each year until the end of the policy tenure. These pay-outs are sufficient to pay your child's school fees in your absence.</p>
<p>These are few key benefits of investing in child education plan over other investments. So why not buy this plan and secure your child's future today?</p>

<h3>What is meant by a childrens education insurance plan?</h3>
<p class="nor-p">The Child Education Policy is a life Insurance product specifically designed as a savings tool to provide an amount of money when child reaches the age for entry into college (18 years and above). The funds can be used to pay for your child's higher educational expenditure. Under this policy, the child is the life secured, while the parent/legal guardian is the policy owner. If one can opt for a pay or benefit rider, the education policy also provides promise that, in the event of the policy owner's untimely demise, the child will have access to the money to help finance his or her studies. Child Education Plan is a single way to save for child's future. To fulfill child's dream &amp; aspirations, commence by making small investments in a Child Education Plan for a short tenure and receive regular payouts for the rest of the tenure in child&rsquo;s future for a fixed period of time.<br /><br /> Primarily there are two type of child insurance. They are;</p>
<div class="nor5-lsts">
<ul>
<li>Insurance for the Child life</li>
<li>Insurance for protecting Child future</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="nor-p">Average size of the households that save for children education is 5.5 members with an average of 1.5 children going to school. These households spend around 5.2 to 5.5 per cent of their income on education expenses. On an average these households save another 10 to 12 per cent of their income for children. If your child is in kindergarten, you can invest commonly for the next 5 years and this Investment Plan will take care of his primary education. If your child is in secondary school, make a small investment every month for the first 6 years, in a plan of 10 years&rsquo; tenure and get a reasonable annual payout for the next 4 years and fulfill your dream of seeing child graduate from a great college. <br /><br /> Child Plans basically work like an endowment plan. Which means, on maturity of the policy, a fixed amount is returned to the parent. This is how it works. The parents pay a premium for a policy. This policy is operational for a number of years. If the parent dies, the child gets the sum assured (amount the policy has been taken out for).  If the parent survives, the sum assured is handed over on maturity of the policy.<br /><br /> If you want a huge lump sum when their child turns 15 and is all set to go to college. So you should buy a 15-year policy when your child is born. When your child turns 15, you will get the money and can use it for whatever education expenses you saved it for. Such policies cover the life risk for a particular period and at the end of this period, the sum guaranteed is paid back to the policy holder.</p>
<h3 class="main-h">Basic Types of Child Plan</h3>
<p class="nor-p">Basically there are two kinds of Child plans; Endowment and ULIP</p>
<h3 class="main-h">Endowment policy</h3>
<div class="nor5-lsts">
<ul>
<li>An endowment policy combines a savings component with protection coverage.</li>
<li>Endowment policies may be either participating or non-participating.</li>
<li>Non-participating policies do not participate in the life Insurance fund&rsquo;s profits but all insurance benefits are fully guaranteed.</li>
<li>Participating policies have a portion of Insurance benefits guaranteed, however the total amount of benefits at maturity is not guaranteed because it depends on the insurance company&rsquo;s life insurance fund&rsquo;s performance</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="main-h">ULIP</h3>
<div class="nor5-lsts">
<ul>
<li>A Unit-linked policy combines the elements of investment and protection based on your requirement as the policy owner.</li>
<li>It offers flexibility as you are able to increase or top-up your monthly premium contribution as your income improves. You may also be more aggressive with your investment. </li>
<li>An Unit-linked policy will allow you to choose the types of funds your money will be invested in. However, like any other investment, there are risks involved and there is no guarantee on the returns, which may be higher or lower than the amount projected.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="main-h">ULIPs under Child plan</h3>
<p class="nor-p">ULIPs vary from conventional insurance in the way they invest your premiums. Unlike endowment plans that invest mainly in government securities and corporate bonds ULIPs can also invest in equities.</p>
<h3 class="main-h">Below, we have summarized some of the key features in a ULIP</h3>
<div class="nor5-lsts">
<ul>
<li>As an investor can make a decision how much your ULIPs must invest in equities and debt. For this ULIPs offer a range of choice with varying equity and debt components. As an investor you can prefer the option based on your risk appetite.</li>
<li>Unlike conventional endowment plans, ULIPs do not guarantee a return; although sum assured is guaranteed provided if one have paid the minimum premiums (even conventional plans no longer assure a return). This is because ULIPs invest in equity and debt markets and offer market-linked returns. Your returns will vary in line with the ULIP's performance.</li>
<li> ULIPs are flexible. Their flexibility is evident in two features. One, they allow individuals to switch across options. For example, as a parent you can afford to have more equity at an early stage of your investment plan for your child's education. As your plan nears the end of its tenure, one can shift their monies to a debt option. Most insurers allow for a determined number of free switches across ULIP options every year. The second feature that makes ULIPs flexible is that they allow for a larger number of withdrawals. In the money back illustration; there were four payments with a bonus payment at the end of the tenure. In a ULIP you can make many more withdrawals over the tenure of the plan; in fact some ULIPs permit multiple withdrawals every year.</li>
<li>ULIP expenses are usually lower than those of conventional endowment plans. Over the long-term, this reflects in the returns of the ULIP.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="main-h">What is Investment Phase!</h3>
<p class="nor-p">Investment phase means the period chosen by the Depositor for which deposit of the Installment shall be made by such Depositor which shall begin from the date of payment of the first premium and subsist till the payment of last premium.</p>
<h3 class="main-h">3 Easy Steps to Choose the Best Child Plan</h3>

</div>
<h3 class="main-h">Importance of planning for your child's future</h3>
<p class="nor-p">As human beings, every parent/s vision is to facilitate the best potential upbringing for their child/children and assure the best of future for them.  There are hardly any stronger desires than providing the best of everything for their child/children. As a parent, the most obvious of the dream would be to plan for your child/children in such a way that all their future necessities are properly taken care of and there is no running around at the time when the actual necessity arises. And for a proper plan to be in place we need to take into account all the realities of the times that we are living in.<br /><br /> As the saying goes 'Time and Tide waits for nobody', very soon parents of young child/children would realize that they are staring at times when a particular necessitate of their child/children is staring them in the face and they are found wanting in terms of how to deal with that need. Other event that assumes equal importance is the wedding of your child/children. A back of the envelope calculation will reveal that monetary requirement for wedding/s will certainly not be less than what you may need for higher education. Starting early and consistency in savings are the two key factors in achieving child's successful future planning.</p>
<h3 class="main-h">Planning for child's education</h3>
<p class="nor-p">There was a time when parents didn't have to plan much for their children's education. The choices were limited in the field of education and even these costs were mainly subsidized. Things are significantly different in the current scenario. Education cost has been rising at a faster pace than inflation, largely due to increasing opportunity and students have begun to explore opportunity abroad. As a result, parents have to support themselves for a larger corpus if they don't want to deprive their children of pursuing their welfare.<br /><br /> If one can take into account other costs such as marriage, (which is applicable both for boys and girls) the future amount could well run into lakhs or even a crore, over a period of 15-20 years. Hence, parents are better off if they plan for their children at an early age. The choice of product, often, depends on the risk desire and ideally, one should have a good balance of risk and safety when it comes to Planning for a Child's Education.  Also, the threat factor depends on the tenure and the availability of time. For instance, if a parent starts planning early and has a time horizon of more than 10 years, he has the luxury of assigning a higher amount to equity and the same does not hold well when the time left is just 1-2 years.</p>
<h3 class="main-h">Tips while Buying a Child Education Plan</h3>
<div class="nor2-p">
<h3>1. Ensure that you opt for the payer benefit rider</h3>
<br /> Look for a policy that waives premium payment in the event the parent/legal guardian can no longer pay for the policy, arising from events such as unfortunate death, diagnosis of a critical illness or total and permanent disability. By opting for the payer benefit rider, your child's education fund will be taken care of should anything happen to you as the parent/legal guardian.</div>
<div class="nor2-p">
<h3>2. Monitor the funds</h3>
<br /> After you buy a policy, you need to monitor it to ensure that you are on your way to reaching your goals. Actual returns declared by the insurance company may differ from initial illustrations due to changes in financial markets. You may also find that the actual cost of higher education may differ as the course selected by your child is different from the one initially planned, or currency exchange rates may rise and fall if an overseas education is preferred. If there is a deficit in the funds required, some policies do provide an additional benefit of a study loan.</div>
<div class="nor2-p">
<h3>3. Check whether the policy qualifies for tax incentive</h3>
<br /> One of the advantages of using life insurance as a savings tool for a child's education policy is the tax benefit. Insurance proceeds are tax-free and you can also obtain an annual tax relief for the payment of premiums for education insurance.</div>
<div class="nor2-p">
<h3>4. Make sure that the premium is affordable</h3>
<br /> Saving through Insurance disciplines a person to regularly continue putting aside money year after year. It is a long-term process and therefore, you need to be practical in estimating how much you can afford based on your current income and expenses. If you start on an amount bigger than you can afford, you may end up having to terminate the policy early and invite financial loss. So, if you cannot afford much now, start with a small amount.</div>
<div class="nor2-p">
<h3>5. Do not add unnecessary coverage</h3>
<br /> Many Children&rsquo;s education policies also offer the ability to add insurance coverage like hospital and surgical medical insurance, or critical illness coverage. Be careful about adding too much insurance coverage as the costs will affect the amount of savings. Furthermore, bear in mind that you are insuring the life of your child, and certain coverage like critical illness may not be essential as the likelihood for such illness in children may be minimal.</div>
